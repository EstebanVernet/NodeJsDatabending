# Notes & comments

### Limitations of image decoders

Every image is a compressed file, which needs to be decoded. For databending, we can identify two types of image decoders :

- The first is the ones we canâ€™t use to read corrupted images, because they are **safe** : if it detects a problem, or a corruption, they stop the process and returns an error.
- On the other hand, we have the ones that donâ€™t care about corrupted files : they behaves **blindly** and continues the process even if the final result will be totally altered.

Every npm image reader packages sadly are in the safe category, and canâ€™t be used for databending purposes.
This step of decoding a corrupted file is crucial to make the final image : We canâ€™t show any preview of the altered image on the web page, but most important, we canâ€™t recompress the image to make it â€˜stableâ€™.

### Uses for research

What we can do is use Node.js to make auto compression and databending at the same time : itâ€™s way easier to do it like that, and look at how different an image behaves with different compressions and extensions. Thatâ€™s why the main program is now used to make batches of altered images.

# Pros & Cons

ðŸŸ¢ A tool that could be online for a better accessibility  
ðŸŸ¢ Corrupt an image quickly & easily  
ðŸŸ¢ Good for trying what looks an image corrupted with different compressions  

ðŸ”´ Image compression are limited by available npm packages  
ðŸ”´ Actually no ways to read a corrupted image using Node.js  
ðŸ”´ Data is removed without knowing where image data is (canâ€™t read data structures for now)  
ðŸ”´ The con just above makes some images broken

Some images are broken and canâ€™t be opened, as mentioned in the cons
